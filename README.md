# Product API
### REST API for managing product entities

## Quick start

```
2. Navigate to the project's root.
```shell
cd product-api
```
3. Run `docker-compose up` (ensure you have Docker running).
4. Open `localhost:8080/swagger-ui` in your web browser of choice.
5. Try endpoints from the UI.

## Notes
* `GET api/product/sum`, by design, returns a response with no body in case none of persisted `product` records match passed-in values (as opposed to zero).
* Be sure to have the default ports (`8080`, `5432`) available â€“ or else reconfigure them.
